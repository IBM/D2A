# Dataset Usage Examples

The current dataset contains the samples generated from 6 open-source projects, namely. OpenSSL, FFmpeg, HTTPD, NGINX, Libtiff, and Libav. 

For each project, there are 3 `pickle.gz` files like `nginx_after_fix_extractor_0.pickle.gz`, `nginx_labeler_1.pickle.gz`, and `nginx_labeler_0.pickle.gz`, which are generated by two slightly different extractors (see `label_source` field in the sample format description). 


## Viewing the Samples in Pickle Files

Each `pickle.gz` file contains compressed samples in JSON (e.g. [auto_labeler_0.json](samples/auto_labeler_0.json)). 

Function [print_sample()](../scripts/dataset_generator/misc/read_pickled_samples.py#L24-L52) in [read_pickled_samples.py](../scripts/dataset_generator/misc/read_pickled_samples.py) reads the JSON objects from pickle file and [decode the compressed static analysis output](../scripts/dataset_generator/misc/read_pickled_samples.py#L49).
Note that by default, [print_sample()](../scripts/dataset_generator/misc/read_pickled_samples.py#L24-L52) only reads the first issue in each file, so it will display `1 issues loaded` even though there are more issues in the file.



## Data Preparation Example  

#### Split
We provide a global split file `splits.csv`, which specifies the `train`, `dev`, and `test` sets:
```
id,split,project
httpd_82b42a45bba53a76fbf167dfe944131e785f5514_1,dev,httpd
...
httpd_1bd8218a89d7b01a14f6172cacfe0e61bee86689_1,test,httpd
...
httpd_598682ce281bf6f4783e9ad3b09639c1686add8e_1,train,httpd
...
```
For example, sample identified by `httpd_82b42a45bba53a76fbf167dfe944131e785f5514_1` belongs to the `dev` set.

**Note:** 
* The sample ids are unique. 
* If you see sample ids like `openssl_fffe56733db3d1a8a2c81c40dedb4f0103a4406a_0` and `openssl_fffe56733db3d1a8a2c81c40dedb4f0103a4406a_1`, it doesn't mean they are the same sample with conflicting labels. Instead, they are different samples:
    - `openssl_fffe56733db3d1a8a2c81c40dedb4f0103a4406a_1` is an `auto_labeler` sample (see [Sample Types](../README.md#sample-types)) from `openssl_labeler_1.pickle.gz`.
    - `openssl_fffe56733db3d1a8a2c81c40dedb4f0103a4406a_0` is an `after_fix_extractor` sample from `openssl_after_fix_extractor_0.pickle.gz`. Basically, we took the positive `auto-labeler` sample `openssl_fffe56733db3d1a8a2c81c40dedb4f0103a4406a_1`, extracted the corresponding functions from the after-fix version, produced the corresponding `after-fix-extractor` sample and assigned `0` as its label. 
    - The `splits.csv` doesn't have the sample types. The data preparation script will add the sample types in the output.




#### Script

The example script [split_data.py](../scripts/data_splits/split_data.py) takes the `splits.csv` ([line 9](../scripts/data_splits/split_data.py#L9)) and the folder with the `pickle.gz` files ([line 13](../scripts/data_splits/split_data.py#L13)) as input. It creates the inputs for BERT model training and testing in a folder specified at [line 14](../scripts/data_splits/split_data.py#L14).
